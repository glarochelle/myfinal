		<p> A toke might make things feel a little simpler, but there's no denying that marijuana laws are downright complicated. While marijuana is legal for recreational use in nine states and the District of Columbia, that could mean anything from dispensaries on every block to a complicated system of "gifting" pot. And medical marijuana? In some states that means anyone with a sore foot can legally buy a bag of green, while in others it means that only severely ill patients – those who suffer from diseases like cancer, AIDS, or multiple sclerosis – have access to oils and tinctures. Even in states where it's still entirely illegal, sometimes getting caught with pot can mean the cost of a parking ticket, while other times it can mean a year behind bars.</p>


<p> Confused? We were, too. With that in mind, here's a brief three state-by-state guide to weed across America </p>

		<p> In Alaska, adults 21 and over can possess up to one ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants, but no more than three mature plants for non-commercial purposes. You're not allowed to smoke in public. 
 </p>

		<p>Patients registered with the state's a medical marijuana program can use weed to treat a host of serious conditions from cachexia (wasting disease), nausea and chronic pain to cancer, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis. There are an estimated 1,178 registered patients in Alaska.
 </p>

		<p>Due to weather conditions, marijuana is grown indoors most of the year, raising concerns about the energy impact of increased indoor lighting as the industry grows.

    <p> Pot is illegal in Arizona – possession of any amount is a felony. However, the state has a thriving medical marijuana industry, with operational 130 dispensaries. Patients suffering from severe conditions like cancer, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, hepatitis C and agitation from alzheimer's disease to have two and a half ounces of pot. </p>

    <p> <p class="blockquote"> <blockquote> Of the 152,979 estimated registered patients, a large majority are chronic pain sufferers
    </blockquote></p></p>

<p> Arizona's medical marijuana law does not require testing for contaminants, an oversight that leaves users vulnerable to marijuana polluted by molds and pesticides.

   <p>The recreational use of marijuana is legal in California. Adults 21 and over can possess up to one ounce, although the sale of any amount of pot remains a misdemeanor punishable with up to 6 months. Adults can also cultivate up to 6 plants.

The legalization of marijuana in the state was preceded by a medical marijuana program. State law doesn't limit the amount that can be grown for personal medical use.</p>

  <p class="blockquote"> <blockquote>Any debilitating illness where the medical use of marijuana has been "deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician" qualified patients for the use of medical pot and patients could get as much pot as they need. </blockquote></p>

<p> Commercial growers are required to store water during the wet winter season. However, unless regulators monitor growers consistently, they might be tempted to divert water from streams, endangering salmon in the area. Meanwhile, illegal grow operations continue to pose an environmental threat in California's forests. Just last year, a team of researchers found traces of dangerous pesticides and human waste at illegal grow sites near waterways.
